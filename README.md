# Jane Street Hall of Mirrors 3 - Interactive Puzzle Solver

An interactive implementation of Jane Street's [Hall of Mirrors 3 puzzle](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/hall-of-mirrors-3-index/). This web application allows you to solve the challenging mathematical logic puzzle online with an intuitive interface.

## About the Puzzle

This is a digital version of the puzzle published by Jane Street Capital. The original puzzle challenges you to place mirrors in a grid and determine the path of light beams. Our implementation brings this brain teaser to life in your browser.

## Technical Stack

This project is built with [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/), a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Solid.js offers:

- Reactive primitives without a virtual DOM
- Lightning-fast performance with minimal overhead
- Component-based architecture
- Fine-grained reactivity for efficient updates

## Features

- Interactive grid-based interface
- Visual representation of light beam paths
- Step-by-step solving capability
- Works on desktop and mobile devices

## How to Play

1. Visit the hosted version or run locally
2. Interact with the grid to place mirrors
3. See how light beams travel through the maze of mirrors
4. Solve the puzzle by correctly placing all mirrors to satisfy the constraints

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
